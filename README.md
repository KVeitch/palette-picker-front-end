## Project Description

Palette Picker helps you to come up with the right color palette for whatever you're working on. Users can generate a color palette, save it for future projects, edit/update saved projects and color palettes, and delete projects and palettes.

We created Palette Picker during our fourth module at the Turing School of Software and Design. It was a two-week partner project. 

This is the repository for the Palette Picker front end. For the front-end repo, please visit https://github.com/KVeitch/palette-picker-back-end.
